## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```css
:root {
    --soft-blue: hsl(215, 51%, 70%);
    --cyan: hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
    --main-dark-blue: hsl(217, 54%, 11%);
    --card-dark-blue: hsl(216, 50%, 16%);
    --line-dark-blue: hsl(215, 32%, 27%);
    --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
}
```
This is the first time that I have use variables in CSS, its was a fun way to learn the basics of them.

```css
.eye-cont {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    border-radius: 8px;
    opacity: 0;
    transition: .4s ease;
    background-color: hsl(178, 100%, 50%, 50%);
}

.eye-svg {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

This was the first time I have used transform within a project, it was very fun to figure out how it worked.
